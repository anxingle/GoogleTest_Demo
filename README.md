# GoogleTest tutorial

This is tiny tutorial for GoogleTest. I will show how to use GoogleTest in my project.

1. Download GoogleTest.

In this project, we use git submodule, so you don't have to download it.

2. build.
```
$> cmake -B build
$> cmake --build build
$> cd build\Debug\ && .\hello_test.ext
```

Coming soon.....
